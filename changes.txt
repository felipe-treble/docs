Prompt for Creating New Files:
================================================================================
The current project is a documentation aimed at creating a knowledge base of the treble.ai SaaS B2B product. We want to maintain accuracy and consistency for the documentation that is available in 3 languages. The source of truth is the /es folder.

For the following list of files, create their relevant files translated into the appropriate languages in the /en and /pt folders. Make sure:

1. DO NOT create other new files different from the ones in the difference
2. KEEP the filename and structure
3. For the translation, make sure internal links like images are kept but internal links that reference other sub-links of the same language are translated
4. Translate each file, but strictly do not add any new additional content. Content must be preserved, just translated.
