In Treble, the WhatsApp links functionality is a strategic tool that allows you to create customized links or QR codes that direct users straight to a WhatsApp number with a predefined message. This functionality is especially useful for optimizing user experience and improving lead management within HubSpot. Below, I'll explain how this functionality can be used in Treble to maximize the effectiveness of your campaigns and personalize interaction with leads.

## üçÑ Storing Contact Source in HubSpot

When a user clicks on a WhatsApp link or scans a QR code that leads to your WhatsApp number, the predefined message can include information about the link's distribution channel. For example, if the link was shared through an email marketing campaign, social media, or paid ads, Treble can store this information in HubSpot.

This allows that, when registering the contact in HubSpot, the lead source is automatically associated with the entry channel. This approach facilitates the analysis of the **effectiveness of each distribution channel**, allowing you to identify which channels are generating more leads or conversions and optimizing marketing resource allocation in the future.

## üöÄ Creating Highly Personalized Flows

Once the contact has been stored in HubSpot, Treble allows the creation of personalized workflows based on the lead's entry channel. This means that leads coming through different channels can be directed to specific and relevant conversations for them.

For example:

- **Leads from social media** can receive a conversation oriented towards interactive content or special promotions that align with the social platform they came from.
- **Leads from email marketing campaigns** can be directed to a conversation that reinforces the messages and offers presented in the original email.

These personalized flows not only improve the conversation's relevance for the user but also increase the **probability of conversion** by offering an experience more tailored to their interests and needs.

## üìí User Segmentation and Analysis

Thanks to the integration of WhatsApp links with HubSpot, Treble allows for more precise user segmentation based on their behavior and entry channel. This segmentation helps you identify patterns in user interaction and adjust your campaigns accordingly.

By having a clear view of which channels are generating more leads and what type of conversation those leads prefer, you can improve the **personalization** and **effectiveness** of your marketing and sales campaigns.
