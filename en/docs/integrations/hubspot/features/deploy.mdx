# Send a Treble Conversation from HubSpot to a Contact

In addition to sending mass messages through HubSpot Workflows, Treble also has the functionality to make individual sends from the customer profile in HubSpot.

To send a message to a person, you must first go to the profile of the customer you want to contact.

Inside the profile, you will find the Treble icon. All you need to do is click on it, select the conversation you want to send, and click on deploy.

<Warning>
    Remember that we can only send outbound conversations. Even though you will find ALL conversations in that icon, you will only be able to send outbound conversations.
