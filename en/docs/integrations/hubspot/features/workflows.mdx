# HubSpot Workflows

In Treble, conversations within HubSpot Workflows are an essential tool for automating and personalizing communication with customers and leads. By integrating these conversations, you can create automatic interactions based on specific user actions, ensuring quick and efficient attention. This not only improves the customer experience but also optimizes your internal processes to increase productivity and conversions.

## Use HubSpot workflows to automate conversation sends

- Create workflows based on contacts, companies, or deals and use the triggers you prefer
- Schedule message sending based on a contact property, such as birthday date or deal close date, using the "Contact date property" workflow type
