<Warning>
    To install the integration of your product with HubSpot, it is crucial that <u>the user has administrator permissions in the HubSpot account.</u>
    
    To verify if you have the necessary permissions, log in to your HubSpot account and go to the "Settings" section (represented by a gear icon in the upper right corner). Then, select "Users & Teams" in the left menu. Here you can see a list of users and their roles. Make sure your role is marked as "Administrator". If you don't have this role, contact the administrator of your HubSpot account to grant you the necessary permissions.

    Why is it important to select the phone property?

    Treble uses one of the two phone properties to identify your contacts. If you don't select the phone property, Treble won't be able to identify your contacts, and you won't be able to send messages through Treble.

    <Info>
      If you're not clear about which property you use, you can go to HubSpot, then to Settings, Properties, and type "phone" in the search box. There you can check which property you use the most. You can watch the following video to make it clearer.
