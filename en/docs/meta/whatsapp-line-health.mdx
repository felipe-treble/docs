WhatsApp is a powerful channel to communicate with your customers—but only if your **line health** is in good condition. If users block or report your messages, or if you violate WhatsApp policies, your ability to send messages may be restricted or even eliminated.

This guide explains how your line health works, what can damage it, and how to keep it in good condition.

## What is WhatsApp Line Health?

**Line health** is the reputation score assigned to your WhatsApp Business API number. WhatsApp monitors how users respond to your messages. If many people block or report you, your quality decreases. If they interact with you, your quality remains high.

### Quality Levels in WhatsApp:

- **Green**: High quality (good interaction, few complaints)
- **Yellow**: Moderate quality (some complaints)
- **Red**: Low quality (high complaint rates – risk of penalty)

## Why Line Health Matters

A poor quality line can result in:

- **Lower message limits** (for example, from 100,000 to 10,000 messages/day)
- **Temporary restrictions** ("With warning" or "Restricted" status)
- **Permanent blocks** (you lose access to the channel)

Good health ensures smooth communication and reliable deliverability.

## Common Reasons Why a Line Gets Penalized

1. **High blocking or reporting rates**  
   Users are annoyed or confused by your messages.

2. **Messages without consent (opt-in)**  
   You contact people who haven't agreed to receive your messages.

3. **Low relevance or engagement**  
   Your messages are ignored or seem like spam.

4. **Policy violations**  
   You send prohibited content or misuse templates.

## 7 Ways to Keep Your WhatsApp Line Healthy

<Steps>

<Step title="Diversify Message Types">
Combine marketing messages with **utility messages** (such as order updates or reminders). Useful content builds trust and reduces blocks.
</Step>

<Step title="Encourage Interaction">
Use quick replies, buttons, or questions to motivate user response. If they respond, it improves your line health.
</Step>

<Step title="Segment Your Audience">
Send relevant messages based on behavior, interests, or customer stage. Avoid sending generic content to everyone.
</Step>

<Step title="Optimize Timing and Frequency">
Avoid sending messages at night or every day. Do it during business hours or based on previous interaction patterns.
</Step>

<Step title="Manage Opt-In and Opt-Out Well">
Only send messages to users who gave their consent, and allow them to unsubscribe easily. Not doing so leads to penalties.
</Step>

<Step title="Use Templates Correctly">
Submit templates for approval, don't change their content afterward, and don't mix promotional content with transactional.
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor Your Line and Feedback">
Check your WhatsApp Manager dashboard frequently. If quality drops or you receive warnings, act immediately.
</Step>

</Steps>
