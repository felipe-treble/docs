## A bit of history

Meta acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. WhatsApp was a messaging app that already had 450 million active users. Meta saw the opportunity to use WhatsApp to connect more people and expand its reach. As the application grew, Meta began to see the opportunity to use WhatsApp to connect businesses with their customers.

In 2016, Meta launched WhatsApp Business, an application that allows businesses to connect to WhatsApp. WhatsApp Business is a free application that allows businesses to send and receive messages. It has more features than the normal WhatsApp application and is optimized for businesses. For example, it allows businesses to have a business profile, which is a profile specifically designed for businesses.

In 2018, Meta launched WhatsApp Business API, an API that allows businesses to connect to WhatsApp and send and receive messages with their customers. WhatsApp Business API is a restricted access API, available only to businesses that have direct access from Meta or that have a partner with access to the API. Treble is one of these partners and uses the WhatsApp Cloud API to allow businesses to send and receive messages at scale.

In 2022, Treble became one of Meta's partners to offer the WhatsApp Business API. That is, Treble is a BSP (Business Service Provider) that allows businesses to connect to WhatsApp and send and receive messages with their customers.
