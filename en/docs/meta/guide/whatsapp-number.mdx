## What does it mean to have a WhatsApp Business API number?

If you have used applications like WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business, you will have noticed that each account has an associated phone number. This number is used to send and receive messages. You probably acquired this phone number when you purchased your personal or business phone line. WhatsApp Business API also requires a phone number to send and receive messages. However, WhatsApp Business API does not have a mobile application.

<Tip>
The fact that WhatsApp Business API does not have a mobile application does not mean that you cannot send and reply to messages from your phone or computer. Precisely, Treble.ai, as a WhatsApp Business API tool, enables an entire digital product so that you can interact with your customers.
</Tip>

Since you want to use WhatsApp Business API to send and receive messages, you also need a phone number associated with your WhatsApp Business API account. Given this need, the following scenarios may exist:

- **You want to purchase a new phone line and use it for WhatsApp Business API**: This is the simplest case. You can purchase a new phone line and use it for WhatsApp Business API.
- **You want to use an existing WhatsApp line**: You or your business (using the traditional WhatsApp application) may have a phone line associated with WhatsApp. In this case, you can use that line for WhatsApp Business API.
- **You want to use an existing WhatsApp Business line**: You or your business (using the WhatsApp Business application) may have a phone line associated with WhatsApp Business. In this case, you can use that line for WhatsApp Business API.
- **You have an existing WhatsApp Business API line with another provider**: If you already have a phone line associated with WhatsApp Business API, you can migrate that line to Treble.ai.

It is extremely important that you evaluate which scenario best reflects your current situation and understand the implications of each scenario.

### Scenario 1: Purchase a new phone line

This is the simplest case. You can approach your phone service provider and purchase a new phone line. This phone line can be a landline or a mobile line. You will not have to do any type of migration of your line or backup of your messages. However, we understand that businesses often already have a phone line known to their customers and prefer not to change. Let's talk about the next scenario.

### Scenario 2: Use an existing WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business line

In this case, you have a phone line associated with WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business. If you want to use that line for WhatsApp Business API, you will have to remove the association of that line with WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business.

### Scenario 3: Migrate an existing WhatsApp Business API line

In this case, you have a phone line associated with WhatsApp Business API with another provider. If you want to migrate that line to Treble.ai, you will have to remove the association of that line with the other provider and associate it with Treble.ai.

#### Choose the scenario that best suits your situation:

## Purchase a new phone line

Approach your phone service provider and purchase a new phone line. This phone line can be a landline or a mobile line. In some countries, there is the option to acquire the phone line with a data and/or telephony plan. This is not necessary to use WhatsApp Business API; the line must only have the ability to receive SMS messages or incoming calls when inserted into a phone.

## Use an existing WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business line

To use an existing WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business line, we recommend that you follow these steps:

1. **Backup your WhatsApp conversations**: If you have an existing WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business line, it is important that you back up your conversations since soon you will delete the association of that line with WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business, therefore you will not be able to access your previous conversations.

    1. Access the WhatsApp application.
    2. Go to the settings section.
    3. Select the "Chats" option.
    4. Then, select the "Chat backup" option.
    5. Follow the instructions to backup your conversations.

2. **Disassociate from normal WhatsApp or Business**: If you want to use an existing WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business line, you will have to disassociate that line from WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business.

    To disassociate your phone line from normal WhatsApp or Business, you can follow these steps:

    1. Access the WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business application.
    2. Go to the settings section.
    3. Select the "Account" option.
        <Warning>
            **It is possible to reverse that the phone line that will be associated with WhatsApp Business API can be returned to normal WhatsApp or Business. However, this is not recommended since the process takes 30 days. Confirm that you want to continue!**
        </Warning>
    4. Then, select the "Delete my account" option. <u>⚠️ (**Read the warning above**) </u>
    5. Follow the instructions to delete your account.

## Prepare the line to receive verification code

An important step is that the phone line you use for WhatsApp Business API has the ability to receive a verification code that Meta will send during the process. For this, we recommend that:

1. If you have a SIM card, make sure the SIM is inserted in a mobile phone.
2. If you have a landline, make sure the line has the ability to receive incoming calls.
3. Try sending a text message or a call to the phone line. If you can receive the message or call, then the line is ready to receive a verification code.

### My line is not in the list of options of the last step

If your line is not in the list of options of the last step, it means that Meta has not yet accepted the name of your WhatsApp account, also known as **Name to display in the WhatsApp chat** (Display Name).

1. **IMPORTANT**: You must now close the Treble.ai tab, we will come back to it later.
2. Enter Meta Business Manager through the following URL: <a class="article-link" target="_blank" href="https://business.facebook.com/"><p>https://business.facebook.com/</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a>

Look for the phone number that you just configured and verify that below the name of the WhatsApp account (Display Name), there is text that says **"Name visible to customers"**. Additionally, you will see a box at the top of the screen that will say: **Congratulations! Your WhatsApp account name has been approved**.

<img src="/images/display-name-approved.png" alt="Display Name" />

6. If the name of your WhatsApp account is not visible to customers, you must wait for Meta to accept the name of your WhatsApp account. This process can take up to 2 hours. You can check the approval status of your WhatsApp account name by refreshing the Meta Business Manager page.
