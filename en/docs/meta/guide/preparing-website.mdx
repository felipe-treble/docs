Meta requires that your website meets certain requirements to connect your WhatsApp number to Treble.ai. This may seem a bit complicated, but don't worry, we'll guide you through the entire process. Make sure you meet all the following requirements:

## Requirements

### 1. Have a website with a valid domain.

Your business must not only be registered, but it must also have a website with a valid domain. This way, Meta can verify that your business is real and that you have control over the WhatsApp number you want to connect. If you don't have a website, we recommend that you create one.

### 2. Legal business name in the footer of your website.

The legal business name must be in the footer of your website. This is a crucial and necessary step for Meta to verify that your business is real and that you have control over your website's domain. By adding this name in the footer, Meta will be able to verify that your website is your property and that you are authorized to use the domain.

For example, if your legal name is **"Treble.ai INC"**, your footer should have something like **"Treble.ai INC - All rights reserved"**.

Check with your hosting provider if you need help adding this name to your website's footer.

### 3. Have email service associated with your domain.

You must have an email service associated with your domain. That is, you must have an email that ends with your domain. For example, if your domain is **"treble.ai"**, your email should be something like **"hello@treble.ai"**.

Emails associated with your domain must be hosted on your own email server. You cannot use third-party services like Gmail, Hotmail, etc.

Check with your hosting provider if you need help adding this email to your domain.

### 4. (Recommended) Have the physical address of the business in the footer of your website.

If you have a physical address, we recommend that you add it to the footer of your website. This is an optional step, but it is highly recommended so that Meta can verify that your business is real.

### 5. (Recommended) Have your business phone number in the footer of your website.

If you have a phone number, we also recommend that you add it to the footer of your website. This is an optional step, but it also helps Meta verify that your business is real.
