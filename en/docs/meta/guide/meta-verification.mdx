## What is Meta verification?

**Meta verification** is a fundamental process to ensure the authenticity and security of business accounts on Facebook and Instagram. Verifying your business portfolio is necessary to use WhatsApp Business API; however, verifying your business will also help you with other Meta products such as advertising.

By verifying your business, you also prevent identity impersonation, which protects you from fraud and protects your reputation.

## Why is Meta verification necessary?

Meta requires verification to confirm that your business is legitimate and to prevent fraud. In turn, Meta needs to verify that your business complies with WhatsApp Business API policies. You can check Meta's policies at the following link: <a class="article-link" target="_blank" href="https://business.whatsapp.com/policy"><p>Meta Policies</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a>

By completing this process, you can:
- Increase the security of your business assets.
- Access advanced features such as advertising campaigns, WhatsApp Business API, and more.
- Comply with Meta policies and avoid unexpected blocks.

## Where is Meta verification done?

You can complete the verification in the **Security Center** within **Meta Business Manager**. To access:
1. Log in to your Meta Business Manager account by accessing <a class="article-link" href="https://business.facebook.com/"><p>https://business.facebook.com/</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a>
2. Click on **Settings** <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" /> in the left menu
3. Find the **Security Center** by scrolling in the **Settings** section and click on it. (You may need to enter your two-factor verification code)
4. Verify that your business portfolio is verified. If it is, you will see a green shield in the **Business Verification** box. <Icon icon="shield-check" iconType="solid" />

## My business is not verified - How can I verify it?

When accessing the security center, you will find the box with your business verification. It's important to note that there are two possible scenarios. <u>Click on the one that corresponds to your case:</u>

## Verification process in Meta

If verification is available, follow these steps:
1. **Click on the Start Verification button**

<img src="/images/start-verification.png" alt="Start Verification" />

2. Follow the steps until Meta asks you to fill in your business information. If you completed the previous step of adding your business information to the business portfolio <a class="article-link" href="/en/docs/meta/guide/business-manager#complete-business-information-in-the-business-portfolio"><p>Complete business information in the business portfolio</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a>, many of the data will already be filled in.

<img src="/images/business-details.png" alt="Start Verification" />

3. (Optional) Choose your business from the **Select business** dropdown menu: Meta tries to identify your business based on the information you have in your business portfolio, and you might find it in the list. If you don't find it, you can choose the option: **My business is not in the list**.

<img src="/images/select-business.png" alt="Start Verification" />

4. **Upload official documents**: If you chose the **My business is not in the list** option, Meta will ask you to upload official business documents to verify it. You need to upload at least one document to continue with the verification process. If this document includes your business address and phone number, Meta will only ask you to upload that document. Otherwise, you will need to upload an additional document to verify the address and phone number.

<u>We always recommend uploading the documents listed by Meta as recommended</u>.

Meta customizes the document options you can upload depending on your country; however, the most common documents are:

- **(Recommended) Incorporation document**: If you have a document that demonstrates your business incorporation along with the address and phone number, upload a photo of the document.
- **(Recommended) Tax registration**: Upload a document that demonstrates your business tax registration.
- **Business license**: If you have a business license, upload the PDF file of the license.
- **Bank statement**: If you have a bank statement, upload the PDF file of the statement.
- **Invoice**: If you have an invoice, upload a PDF file of a service invoice used by your business, ideally the invoice should have your business address and phone number.

5. Final step, Meta verification code: Meta will send a verification code to your email. Remember that we recommended you have an email service with your domain? Now is the time to use it. Enter an email address with your domain and write the verification code sent by Meta.

<Tip>We recommend checking your spam folder to make sure the email arrived.</Tip>

<img src="/images/verify-email.png" alt="Start Verification" />

<Check>Done! Your business is now in the verification process. This process can take 1 to 2 days.</Check>

## I was rejected in Meta verification - What do I do next?

If your verification was rejected, you can relaunch the verification process. However, before trying again, make sure that:

- The information in the business portfolio section is complete.
- Check that your business information in the business portfolio matches your business information in the document you uploaded.
- If you selected one of the businesses that Meta suggested in the list, when you try verification again, don't choose the same business, but the option **My business is not in the list**.
- Make sure your website is updated and not just a landing page.
- Make sure your website meets all the requirements listed in the <a class="article-link" href="/en/docs/meta/guide/preparing-website"><p>Preparing your website</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a> section.

## Exceptional Cases

In some cases, even when you meet all the requirements, Meta may not allow you to complete the verification process. In this case, you may get an error when executing the step of choosing your business, or your business may not appear in the business list.

If this happens to you, you should:

1. Log in to your business portfolio in Meta Business Manager.
2. Look for the WhatsApp Business Manager option by accessing: **Settings** <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" /> in the left menu, then look for **Accounts** and in accounts select the option **WhatsApp Accounts**.
3. If you completed the step of enabling the verification button with Treble.ai, you will see a WABA created with Treble.ai. Here, scroll in the right panel and click on the **WhatsApp Manager** option.

4. At the top of this section, you will see a message to request a review. Click on the **Request review** button, and follow the steps to request a review of your account. Upon completing this step, Meta will re-enable the start verification button in the security center. This review can take between 1 to 2 days.
