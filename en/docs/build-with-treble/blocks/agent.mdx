## Transfer to Agent

The transfer to agent block is a powerful tool that allows you to configure your Treble flows to decide at which parts of the conversation you want to continue the chat with an advisor/agent from your team. Adding this block is very simple and allows you to offer personalized and efficient attention.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the agent team">
    If this is the first time you're adding this block, you'll find that the block has the `DEFAULT` team selected. This team is the default agent team that was created when you created your Treble account. However, you can select another agent team that you already have created. To do this, double-click on the block, this will display a menu where you can select the agent team you want.
