In Treble, the Second HSM functionality is a key tool for improving interaction with leads and customers through WhatsApp. The strategic use of the second HSM is particularly effective for recovering leads or customers who haven't responded to previous messages, significantly increasing the overall response rate. Below, I'll provide a more detailed explanation of how this tool works and how it can help you maximize the performance of your WhatsApp campaigns.

## üêç Recovery of Non-Responsive Leads/Customers

The second HSM in Treble is specifically designed to recapture the attention of leads or customers who didn't respond to the first contact. Often, a lead might not respond for various reasons: distraction, lack of time, or simply because the first message didn't resonate enough with their interests. The second HSM offers an opportunity to re-engage these leads effectively.

- **Strategic Re-contact**: By sending a second HSM, Treble allows you to keep the conversation open without seeming invasive. This message can be designed to directly address possible concerns, offer more information, or simply kindly remind the user that they have a pending conversation. The idea is to provide additional value or an incentive that motivates the lead to respond.
- **Message Personalization**: The second HSM can be highly personalized in Treble, adapting to the lead's context and history of previous interactions. This means it's not just a generic reminder, but a message that feels relevant and specifically targeted to the user's needs.

## ü•¢ Increase in Total Response Rate

One of the most significant advantages of using the second HSM is its impact on the overall response rate. According to data collected by Treble, this second message can capture up to 40% of the total responses you could get in a WhatsApp campaign. This increase is crucial, especially in campaigns where the initial response rate is low.

- **Reach Maximization**: By capturing additional responses with the second HSM, you're expanding the effective reach of your campaign without needing to increase investment in lead acquisition. In other words, you're doing more with the resources you already have, improving campaign efficiency.
- **ROI Improvement**: By increasing the response rate, you're also improving the return on investment (ROI) of your campaign. Each lead recovered thanks to the second HSM is an additional conversion opportunity that would otherwise have been lost.

## üë£ Strategies for an Effective Second HSM

For the second HSM to be truly effective in Treble, it's important to consider certain strategies:

- **Proper Timing**: The moment you send the second HSM is crucial. There should be enough time between the first message and the second to not seem pushy, but not so much that the lead forgets the conversation context.
- **Clear Call to Action**: The second HSM should include a clear and convincing call to action. This could be a reminder of an offer that's about to expire, an invitation to a webinar, or simply a link to schedule a call.
- **Offering Additional Value**: Often, a lead might need a small push to respond. Consider offering additional value in the second HSM, such as an exclusive discount, a free download, or early access to a product or service.

<Note>
The use of the second HSM must be intelligent and strategic. For example, if a customer sends their first message at 3 PM and you decide that the second message should be sent 16 hours later, it could arrive in the early morning hours, which can be very invasive for the customer. Additionally, the second HSM is more likely to be perceived as intrusive, which could lead to being blocked by the customer. Therefore, it's crucial to consider timing and customer perception when planning to send the second HSM.

## ü¶ë Integration and Automation in Treble

Treble allows for the automation of second HSM sending within your WhatsApp workflows, which means that once configured, you won't have to worry about manually following up with each lead. The system can automatically trigger the sending of the second message based on predetermined rules, such as lack of response after a specific time.

- **Continuous Optimization**: Additionally, Treble offers analytics tools that allow you to measure the effectiveness of the second HSM in real-time. This gives you the opportunity to adjust the message, segmentation, or timing to continuously improve results.
