Goal blocks in Treble are fundamental tools for structuring and monitoring the effectiveness of automated conversational flows. These blocks allow users to define and measure specific goals in customer interactions, which facilitates tracking progress within a conversation flow. Goals can represent different important milestones, such as completing a registration, scheduling an appointment, downloading a document, confirming a purchase, or any other key action that the user should perform.

üéà**Clear goal definition**: Goal blocks allow you to precisely specify what user action or behavior is considered a success within the flow. This can be an affirmative response, choosing a particular option, or completing a critical step in the conversational process.

üíº **Real-time monitoring**: Once the flow is active, the system monitors how many users manage to complete the established goals. This real-time monitoring offers a clear view of interaction performance and allows for informed decisions about whether the flow is fulfilling its purpose.

üìí **Actions based on goal completion**: When a user meets a goal, the system can trigger a series of automated actions. This can include ending the conversational flow, activating a new flow, sending a notification to the sales or support team, or even updating records in the CRM. All of this ensures that conversational flows are not only interactive but also results-oriented.

üêç **Continuous optimization**: Goal blocks are essential for optimizing conversational flows. By measuring how many users reach the defined goals, teams can identify bottlenecks or friction points that affect conversion. This allows for adjustments in messages, wait times, or presented options to improve overall performance.

üëèüèº **Segmentation and personalization**: Goals can be used to segment users based on their behavior. For example, those who complete a purchase can be directed to specific post-sale flows, while those who don't can receive a follow-up or reminder flow. This facilitates more personalized and relevant communication for each user.

**Common use cases**

- **Sales**: Use a goal block to confirm that a customer has made a purchase or has shown interest in a specific product.
- **Support**: Define a goal when a user has resolved an issue or has accessed appropriate support resources.
- **Marketing**: Set a goal when a potential customer has completed a form or registered for an event.
