## Campaign Objective

In the <a class="article-link" href="/en/docs/intro-to-treble/welcome"><p>Introduction to Treble</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a> section, you learned about Treble's key concepts such as conversations, blocks, templates, and more. Now, we're going to dive deeper into how you can create your conversations in Treble thinking about your campaign objectives.

WhatsApp is a very powerful channel for communicating with your customers. However, it's not enough to just send a message and wait for the customer to respond. You need to have a clear objective for your campaign and create a conversation that allows you to reach that objective.

Start by asking yourself the following questions:

1. What type of communication do you want to have with your customers?
2. What type of inbound or outbound conversation do you need to reach that objective? Do you want your customers to start a conversation with you? Or do you want to initiate the conversation with them?
3. What type of interaction do you want to have with your customers? Do you want to store information from their responses to use in future conversations? Do you want your customers to be able to rate your product or service?
4. What type of content do you want to send to your customers? Do you want to send them a promotional message? Do you want to send them an informative message? Do you want to send them a quality message?
5. What type of target audience do you have? Do you want to send a message to all your customers? Do you want to send a message to customers who have purchased a product or service?

Asking yourself these questions will allow you to create a conversation that helps you reach your objective.

## Recommendations in Treble

In Treble, we recommend that before creating a conversation, you have the following points very clear:

1. **Conversation objective**: Define the objective of the conversation. Some examples are:
    - Marketing your services or products. You can even measure the conversion rate of your campaigns. You can use the <a class="article-link" href="/en/docs/build-with-treble/blocks/goal-block"><p>Goal Block</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a> functionality.
    - Receive information from your customers to qualify them.
    - Send useful information such as appointment reminders, payment reminders, etc.
    - Send simple notifications or verification codes.
2. **Type of communication**: Define if the conversation is inbound or outbound.
    - If you expect your customers to start a conversation with you, how do you expect them to start the conversation? You can have a QR code, a link on your website, a phone number, etc.
    - If you're going to directly contact your customers, where do you have their information? In your CRM? In your database? On your website?
3. **Segmentation**: Define who you want to send the message to. To all your customers? To customers who have purchased a product or service?
    - We recommend that you segment your customers by groups. For example, you can have a group of customers who have purchased a product or service and another group of customers who haven't.
    - Communication through WhatsApp is an art. It's not enough to send a message and wait for the customer to respond. You need to experiment and test different messages to see which one works best. We recommend that if you expect to send a campaign to a very large group of customers, first test it on a smaller group to see if it works. Example: If you expect to send a campaign to 1000 customers, first test it on 100 customers to see if it works. You can even use the <a class="article-link" href="/en/docs/build-with-treble/blocks/ab-test"><p>A/B Testing Block</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a> functionality to measure the conversion rate of your campaigns.
4. **Content**: Define the content you want to send to your customers.
    - WhatsApp is a very rich communication channel. You can send images, videos, audio, documents, etc. Experiment by adding emojis to your messages to make them more attractive.
    - Additionally, WhatsApp has functionalities like interactive buttons, message lists, etc. You can use these functionalities to create a more interactive and personalized conversation.
