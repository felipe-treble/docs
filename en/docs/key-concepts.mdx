## Conversations

Conversations, also known as campaigns, are message flows that allow you to interact with your contacts/customers. When you open the Treble platform, you'll see a list of conversations you've created.

### Outbound Conversation

Outbound conversations, also known as company-initiated conversations, are those sent to a group of contacts/customers. These conversations in Treble must start with a template (HSM), and then you can add message blocks to continue the conversation. To learn more about templates, you can read the [Templates (HSM)](/en/docs/meta/hsm-templates) section. Some examples of this type of conversations are:

- You have a database with phone numbers of potential customers who have left their information on your website. We want to send them a message telling them about the week's promotion.
- You manage a computer repair business and want to send your customer a message confirming that their computer is ready for pickup.
- You maintain your customer information in a CRM and want to contact your prospects to qualify them via WhatsApp.

### Inbound Conversation

Inbound conversations, also known as customer-initiated conversations, are those received from a contact/customer. This type of conversation is ideal when you want your contacts/customers to initiate a conversation with you. Some examples of this type of conversations are:

- A customer who sees your phone number on your website and sends you a message for help.
- A customer who scans a QR code and sends you a message to contact you about a promotion.
- A customer who clicks on an Instagram ad and writes to you to learn more about your product.

## Templates (HSM)

Templates, also known as HSM (Highly Structured Message), are predefined messages that are used in WhatsApp Business API conversations, mainly used in outbound conversations. To learn more about templates, you can read the [Templates (HSM)](/en/docs/meta/hsm-templates) section.

## Agents

In Treble, you can configure your conversations to be sent to an agent. Agents are Treble users who use the agent platform to send and receive messages from conversations that you've configured to be transferable to an agent. To learn more about agents, you can read the [Agents](/en/docs/agent-platform/welcome) section.

## WABA (WhatsApp Business Account)

WABA, also known as "WhatsApp Business Account", is the business account that allows companies to interact with their customers through the WhatsApp messaging platform in a more professional way and with additional functionalities.

Main features of a WABA:

1. Verification: WABA accounts are verified, which helps build trust among users.
2. Business profile: Allows displaying important company information such as address, hours, website, etc.
3. WhatsApp Business API access: This enables message automation and integration with other company systems.
4. Interactive messages: Ability to send messages with interactive elements like buttons or clickable links.
5. Advanced conversation management: Facilitates handling multiple conversations and customers more efficiently.
