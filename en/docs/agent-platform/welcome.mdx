## Agent Platform

Treble's agent platform allows you or your team to continue your conversations with your customers on WhatsApp. The platform is similar to WhatsApp Web, where you'll see incoming conversations from your customers but has additional functionalities.

With the agent platform, you'll find four main sections:

1. **Dashboard**: If your advisors have administrator permissions, they will see the dashboard. From here you can see the status of your agents, your conversations, your settings, your integrations, etc.
2. **Conversations**: Here you'll see incoming conversations from your customers. This view is similar to the WhatsApp Web view and will show your customer chats.
3. **Main Conversation**: Here you'll see the main conversation you have selected. As agents, you can respond to incoming messages from your customers.
4. **Information Panel**: Here you'll see relevant information about the current conversation.
