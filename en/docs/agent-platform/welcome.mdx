# Agent Platform

Treble's agent platform allows you and your team to continue your conversations with your customers on WhatsApp. The platform is similar to WhatsApp Web, where you'll see incoming conversations from your customers, but it has additional features.

# How to access the agent platform?

When you start using Treble, you'll have access to 2 main platforms: app.treble.ai and sales.treble.ai. When we talk about the agent platform, we're referring to <a class="article-link" href="https://sales.treble.ai"><p>sales.treble.ai</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a>, where you and your agents can manage chats with your customers.

You can access it in 3 ways:

1. Directly through the platform link <a class="article-link" href="https://sales.treble.ai"><p>sales.treble.ai</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a>
2. If you have Treble integrated with HubSpot <Icon icon="hubspot" iconType="brands" />, you can access it from the HubSpot dashboard: CRM -> Inbox -> WhatsApp.

# Types of Agents

In Treble, there are 2 types of agents:

## Salesperson or Agent

An agent - salesperson will only be able to view chats and language. It's essential that they set themselves as "active" to receive chats.

It's also important that when they finish their shift, they set themselves as inactive, so that new chats go to an agent who is actually available, and also so that metrics like "first response times" and other performance metrics for your agents are more accurate.

### Sections of the agent platform

Below you can see each section of the agent platform:

1. This is the space where your agents can write messages.
2. Treble Boost âœ¨: create and train different artificial intelligence assistants to provide appropriate responses efficiently.
    <Warning>Only administrator users can create these assistants.</Warning>

3. Add emojis! ðŸš€ You can even view stickers if they send them to you.
4. Select this icon to attach files.
5. Write notes about this conversation, either as a reminder for yourself or for another agent to access the information. Don't worry! The customer doesn't see these notes.
6. Send HSM messages manually. Select this icon and choose the HSM you want to send. To learn more about HSM messages, you can read this article: <a class="article-link" href="/en/docs/meta/hsm-templates"><p>What are HSM messages?</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a>
7. In this section, you'll see all ongoing conversations.
8. Here you'll see all contacts with whom the company has interacted.
9. End one or multiple chats simultaneously.
10. Generate summaries assisted by Treble Boost for precise tracking of the interaction.
11. End a single chat, the one that's open.
12. Edit the contact's name in Treble. This action doesn't involve changes to the information in HubSpot.
13. Add color tags! You can mark chats with the tags you need to view them in an organized way and make markings that are important to you.

    <Warning>Only administrator users can create tags, and vendor users can use them.</Warning>

14. Transfer the chat to another agent or group.
15. Remember that Meta gives us 24 hours to carry out a conversation with a customer. When the customer writes/responds to us, the time resets to 24 hours available for your agent to respond.
16. View the contact's information in HubSpot. You can see name, phone, email, and contact owner.
17. Use quick response templates to save time. For example, a greeting, a defined offer, or the terms and conditions of a business.

    <Warning>Quick response templates are different from HSM messages. The latter are high security messages that Meta approves or not to open a chat with a customer. Templates can only be created by administrator users and are pre-defined messages to provide faster responses.</Warning>

18. Review files, documents, and voice notes that have been shared in this chat.
19. Send voice notes! ðŸŽ¤
20. Open the contact in HubSpot for more details.

## Administrator
