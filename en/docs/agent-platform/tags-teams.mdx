## Agent Teams

With Treble, you can create agent teams so your advisors can work together on your customer conversations. Think of teams as groups of agents that allow you to organize your conversations.

For example, you can create one agent team for your sales conversations and another team for your support conversations.

This allows your advisors to work on different conversations without mixing them up. Additionally, you can assign permissions to your advisors so they can view and respond to your customer conversations.

## Agent roles

In Treble, agents can have different roles. These roles allow you to control access to your customer conversations.

- **Agents**: Agents are those who respond to your customer conversations. They can only respond to conversations that have been assigned to them. Additionally, they cannot access any items in the Treble dashboard.
- **Supervisors**: Supervisors have greater control over your customer conversations. Supervisors are ideal when you want to have team members who can monitor your customer conversations. However, supervisors cannot make all adjustments to Treble's configuration.
- **Administrators**: Administrators have full access to Treble's configuration. They are the ones who can create, edit, and delete agent teams. Additionally, administrators can assign roles to agents and supervisors, as well as modify Treble's configuration.

    Once you've created the team, you'll be able to see it in the team list in the transfer to agent block in the conversation editor. To see this block, read the [Transfer to Agent Blocks](/en/docs/build-with-treble/blocks/agent) section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign teams to your agents">
    In the **Agents** section, you can see the agents you have created. Click on the **Edit** button <Icon icon="pencil" iconType="solid" /> to assign a team. You can select multiple teams for the same agent. Keep in mind that if you assign multiple teams to the same agent, this agent will be able to respond to conversations from all teams you have assigned.
