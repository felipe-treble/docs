In **Treble.ai**, the **library of pre-edited quick messages** is an essential resource to make customer service **more efficient, standardized, and agile**. With this functionality, agents can answer frequently asked questions and interact with customers in a **quick and consistent** manner, without having to write the same information repeatedly.

## **How does the quick message library work?**

Treble.ai allows agents to store and use **preconfigured messages** to streamline customer service. These messages can be used for:

- **Answers to frequently asked questions**, such as service hours and payment instructions.
- **Standardized information about products and services**.
- **Detailed guidance on internal processes**.

### **Ease in training new agents**

New agents can use the library to **respond with more confidence and precision**, reducing the learning curve.
