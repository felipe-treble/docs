# What is Treble Boost?

Treble Boost is one of our newest artificial intelligence features, developed to transform and streamline marketing and sales interactions on WhatsApp. It is our solution for the growing needs of marketing and sales professionals looking to optimize their processes and improve efficiency in their daily operations, enabling more effective contact with their customers.

Agents can receive message suggestions directly in the chat to answer complex questions in seconds, based on customized information in PDF, CSV, or plain text formats. This ensures quick and accurate responses, increasing brand consistency and efficiency in every interaction.

**AI Summary:**

In addition to sending quick and comprehensive responses, there is also the possibility of obtaining instant and accurate summaries of conversations for immediate context. These summaries are displayed in the notes section of the sales platform and in HubSpot, avoiding repetitive questions, saving time, and improving the customer experience.

**AI Audio to Text Transcription:**

Transcribe audio messages to text with a single click, allowing sales agents to read the transcriptions and manage audios more efficiently. This results in faster responses to customers and better time management.

## What are the advantages of using Treble Boost?
