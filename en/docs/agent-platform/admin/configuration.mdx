# How to manage HSM template visibility?

From the **Configuration > HSM Preferences** section, you can control which agent teams have access to each HSM message template. This functionality allows you to organize and restrict the use of templates according to the needs of each group, ensuring that each team only sees the templates relevant to their operation.

## What information is shown?

In the table, you will find a list of all HSM templates available in your account, along with the following data:

- **HSM Template:** Template name and a fragment of the content it contains.
- **Category:** Classification assigned to the template (for example, "Marketing").
- **Permissions:** Teams that have visibility and access to use the template.
- **Last modification date:** Last time the template was updated or edited.

> Templates that appear as "None of the teams" will not be visible to any agent until specific permissions are configured.

## How to edit template permissions?

To change the visibility of a template:

1. Click on the **Permissions** column in the row of the template you want to edit.
2. A menu with all available teams will be displayed.
3. Check or uncheck the teams you want to give access to.
4. Click on **Save changes** to apply the configuration.

> âœ… You can select the "All teams" option to enable global use of a template.

## What is this functionality for?

This tool is useful if you have different teams using Treble for different purposes (sales, support, collection, etc.) and want to avoid confusion when selecting templates. By assigning specific permissions, you guarantee a more organized and relevant experience for agents.

Do you have duplicate templates or templates you no longer use? You can clean them up and then update the permissions to keep your account tidy.
