In this article, we will guide you through the metrics available in **sales.treble.ai** and show you why they are fundamental to the operational success of your company. Metrics are not just numbers: they are a key tool for understanding what is working, what needs adjustment, and how to continuously improve.

Here you will discover how to measure your **agents' performance** and the **real reach of your campaigns**, which will allow you to make more strategic, agile, and results-oriented decisions. If you are looking to optimize your commercial operation with reliable and actionable information, this article is for you.

# Why is it important to monitor your agents?

As an administrator of the agent platform, it is important that you analyze the performance of sales agents and verify if they are paying due attention to each user.
Daily monitoring of agents is key to identifying the volume of chats in their inbox, response time, as well as the duration and periods of inactivity in conversations.

## Where to find the metrics panel

To access the metrics panel, first, log in to your <a class="article-link" href="https://sales.treble.ai"><p>sales.treble.ai</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a> account and then go to the **Metrics** section. Remember that to access this section, you must be an administrator of the platform.

In this window, you can filter by team, salespeople, or tags, with a summary of metrics from your sales operation. You also have the option to apply date filters.

Now we will explain them one by one so you can make the most of them.

## Available metrics

### Filters

At the top of the **metrics panel**, you will find the **filters** option, an essential tool for adjusting the data visualization according to what you need to analyze.

<img src="/images/agent-metrics-3.png" alt="Filters" />

You can apply different types of filters:

• **By Teams**: here you can select any of the teams that have been previously created on the platform.

• **By Salespeople**: you will see all the salespeople who are registered on the platform, allowing you to analyze the individual performance of each one.

• **By Tags**: allows you to filter by each of the tags you have created, useful for classifying conversations by campaigns, products, segments, etc.

Additionally, you will find other key filters:

• **By Country**: this filter allows you to segment chats according to the country code from which they were generated.

• **By Date**: includes predefined options such as *Today*, *Yesterday*, *Last 7 days*, *1 month*, and *3 months*.

You can also customize the date range you want to query using the calendar icon.

<Tip>
Sales only shows metrics corresponding to the **last 90 days** (counting from the current day). If you need to access earlier information, you will need to request it directly from the support team.

Don't forget to click on Apply filters to execute your selection

### Chat dynamics and volume

In the second part of the **metrics panel**, you will find key information to understand the volume and dynamics of attention in your operation. Here you can see three main indicators:

- **Chats received**: represents the total number of conversations that have arrived on the platform, regardless of whether they were answered or not. This data helps you measure the demand you are receiving.
- **Distinct contacts**: shows you how many unique users have contacted you. It is useful for identifying the real reach of your campaigns or understanding how many new customers you are serving.
- **Transferred conversations**: indicates how many times a conversation has been transferred between agents. This number can help you detect bottlenecks or training needs within the team.

Just below these indicators, you will find an **interactive graph** that visualizes these three data points. You can customize its view to analyze the results by **day**, **week**, or **month**, which allows you to identify patterns and trends in different time periods.

### Times

In the **third part of the metrics panel**, you can analyze in depth the **attention times** and critical points in the flow of conversations. This section allows you to evaluate the efficiency of your salespeople and detect opportunities for improvement in the operation.

Here you will find the following indicators:

• **Pending chats to assign**: shows the number of conversations that have arrived but have not yet been assigned to any salesperson.

This data helps you identify if there are bottlenecks or if the load distribution between teams needs to be adjusted.

• **First interaction (Chat)**: measures the time that passes from when the chat is assigned to a salesperson until that salesperson sends their first response.

This indicator reflects the **agility of response once the agent already has the chat in their hands**.

• **First response (Salesperson)**: calculates the time from the creation of the chat (when the customer sends the first message) until the salesperson responds for the first time.

This is a good reflection of the **total customer wait time from when they initiate contact**.

• **Completion by salesperson**: measures how much time passes from when the chat is created until it is finalized by the agent.

It is useful for understanding how long the complete cycle of a conversation lasts.

• **Chat resolution**: shows the time it takes to resolve a conversation from when it was assigned until its completion.

This indicator gives you visibility on **the agent's efficiency when handling active chats**.

Below these indicators, you will see an **interactive graph** that allows you to clearly visualize each of these metrics. You can choose to see the results by **day**, **week**, or **month**, depending on the period you want to analyze.

Additionally, you will find a **detailed table** showing the average times, compliance percentages, and the number of chats evaluated in each metric.

### Service rating/satisfaction survey

In the **fourth part of the metrics panel**, you can visualize your **customer satisfaction**, a key element for evaluating the quality of the service you are offering.

This section shows the **average rating** that users have given to agents after their interactions. This metric allows you to identify if customers are having a good experience or if there are areas for improvement in the service.

In addition to the general rating, you will find an **interactive graph** that allows you to visualize how satisfaction has evolved over time. You can change the view to see the results **by day, week, or month**, and thus identify patterns or variations in the quality of service.

Just below, you will see a **detailed table** where ratings received from **1 to 5 stars** are grouped, including:

• The **percentage** of responses that each rating represents.

• The **total number** of responses for each level of satisfaction.

This section also has filters by **day, week, or month**, which gives you flexibility to analyze the information according to the period you are interested in.

### Interaction Data

<img src="/images/agent-metrics-9.png" alt="Detailed table" />

In the **fifth and final part of the metrics panel**, you will find a view focused on the **interaction patterns** of your users, ideal for understanding **when** the highest volume of conversations occurs and adjusting your resources more strategically.

This section shows you:

• **Days with most chats**: identifies the days of the week in which you receive the highest volume of conversations, based on average data.

• **Days with fewest chats**: shows the days with the least activity, which allows you to better balance the operational load.

• **Hours with most chats**: highlights the time slots with the highest flow of messages, helping you optimize your team's availability.

All this data is presented in average format, so you have a clearer and more consistent view of the general behavior of your customers.

Additionally, this view includes a **heat map** that visually reflects the moments of highest and lowest activity, crossing days and hours. The more intense the color, the higher the volume of chats at that time.
