Treble's Mobile App is an application that allows them to search for users and contacts, view message history, and send HSMs to users to start conversations with customized values. By having the application on their phone, agents receive push notifications when there are new messages or conversations.

Also when receiving a response, conversations will appear in the chat list. You can interact similarly to the platform, sending images and files, which can be downloaded or added from the phone.

Additionally, it allows transferring conversations to specific teams or salespeople, sorting messages according to your needs, and managing active or inactive status on the platform.
