description: "Let's learn how to use Treble's main view to respond to conversations as an agent and some of the tools you can use."
---

## Sections of the Main View

When you first log into the platform, you'll see the main view. This view is divided into 3 sections: the incoming conversations view, the view for responding to conversations, and a panel on the right with account information. Let's understand how each section works.

### Incoming Conversations View

<img src="/images/agent-left.png" alt="Incoming Conversations View" />

In this view, you'll see all the incoming conversations you have on the platform. If you've used platforms like WhatsApp Web or ticketing tools, you'll see the conversations you've received.

As an agent, you'll start receiving incoming conversations. By clicking on a conversation, you'll see the conversation history and be able to respond to it.

#### Active Status of an Agent

An important point is that as an agent, you can only see incoming conversations if your status is active. If your status is inactive, new conversations will not be assigned to you.

To change your status, you can do so in the configuration panel on the left, by clicking on your profile icon and then clicking on **Change to active**. You'll know you're active when you see your profile icon in green.

<img src="/images/agent-active.gif" alt="Active Status of an Agent" />

Similarly, you can change your status to inactive by clicking on your profile icon and then clicking on **Change to inactive**.

<Warning>
Closing the tab, logging out, or closing the browser window <u>will not set your status back to inactive</u>. To do this, you must click on your profile icon and then click on **Change to inactive**.

If your agent doesn't change their status to inactive, they will continue to receive incoming conversations.
</Warning>

<Note>
It's important to mention that as an agent you can only receive conversations if you belong to a team and the conversation is for your team. If you don't belong to a team, or you belong to a team but the conversation isn't for your team, you won't be able to see the conversation.
</Note>

Additionally, you can sort incoming conversations by the following criteria:

- Last message sent
- Last message by client
- New conversations
- Transferred conversations
- Tag color

To search for a conversation, you can use the search field at the top. You can also use the search field to search for a conversation by the customer's phone number.

### View for Responding to Conversations

<img src="/images/agent-center.png" alt="View for Responding to Conversations" />

When you click on an incoming conversation, you'll see the view for responding to the conversation. In this view, you'll see the conversation history and be able to respond to it. This view reflects the conversation history in real time. You'll even find read receipts and message delivery receipts for WhatsApp messages.

In the top panel you'll see (from left to right):

- The customer's name. This can be the name that the customer has in their WhatsApp account or you'll see the customer's phone number.
- Session duration: Chats can only be kept open for 24 hours. If the customer doesn't respond within that time, the chat will close and you won't be able to respond.
- <Icon icon="sparkles" /> Artificial intelligence function to generate a summary of the conversation. Your agent can use this function to generate a summary of the conversation.
- <Icon icon="circle-check" /> Button to end the conversation with the customer.
- <Icon icon="pencil" /> Button to edit customer information.
- <Icon icon="tag" /> Button to add a tag to the conversation.
- <Icon icon="arrow-right-arrow-left" /> Button to transfer the conversation to another agent.

### Account Information Panel

In the account information panel, you'll see additional information about the conversation. Here you can find **Contact information**, **Quick response templates**, and **Attached files and documents**.

## Transferring Conversations

Offer a smoother experience to your customer by transferring chats to other departments or agents.

<img src="/images/transfer-conversation.png" alt="Transferring Conversations" />

### Why is it important to master conversation transfers?

Sometimes, our customers contact us to deal with a specific issue, but they may select an incorrect option in the decision tree or interpret the available options differently than intended.

Another important situation is when you need to change your status to inactive on the platform, making it necessary to transfer the conversation to a colleague who will continue with customer service.

### How to transfer a conversation?

To transfer a conversation, click on the two arrows icon located in the upper left corner of the page, in the top menu.

<img src="/images/transfer-chat.gif" alt="How to transfer a conversation" />

Next, the tool will ask if you want to transfer to a group of agents or to a specific agent.

<img src="/images/transfer-chat-2.gif" alt="Transfer options" />

<Warning>
When transferring to a group, it's important to know the configured conversation assignment rule. When you direct a chat to a group instead of a specific agent, Treble uses the rule defined by the administrator to determine which member of the group will receive the conversation.
</Warning>

When choosing which agent you want to transfer the chat to, the tool will also ask which group they belong to. This happens because an agent can be in more than one group, and we need to define which queue of this agent you want to transfer to.

<img src="/images/transfer-chat-3.gif" alt="Transfer to a specific agent" />

Example: Agent Lucas receives conversations from the Sales and Support groups. When transferring a conversation to him, you'll need to specify through which group you want to make the assignment.

**Congratulations! After selecting the agent and clicking on transfer, the conversation will appear in the new agent's inbox.**

<img src="/images/transfer-chat-4.gif" alt="Completed transfer" />

<Tip>
When you receive a transferred conversation, it's possible to see which agent made the transfer.

## Conversation Tags

Tags are a way to categorize conversations. You can add tags to conversations so you can organize and search for them more easily.

<img src="/images/add-label.gif" alt="Add Tag" />

In [Treble.ai](http://Treble.ai), the strategic use of **tags** has become a fundamental and indispensable element to significantly improve the **organization, prioritization, and analysis** of the various interactions that occur daily between agents and customers. This intelligent categorization system allows for more efficient and structured management of the communication flow, ensuring that each interaction is properly classified and managed.

### **How do tags work in Treble.ai?**

[Treble.ai](http://Treble.ai) allows you to add **custom tags** to conversations, categorizing the interactions according to your needs. These tags help structure the workflow and can be used to:

- **Filter and locate conversations quickly** within the platform.
- **Track the status** of a service (example: "Pending", "Resolved", "Waiting for response").
- **Identify patterns of behavior and customer needs**.

<img src="/images/add-label-1.gif" alt="Using tags" />

### **Main benefits of using tags in Treble.ai**

- **Organization and prioritization**

Tags allow agents to classify conversations by **type of service, urgency, or department**, facilitating management and preventing important messages from going unanswered.

- **Improvement in internal communication**

With standardized tags, agents can quickly identify the context of the conversation and continue the service without needing to read the entire history.

- **Generation of strategic reports**

[Treble.ai](http://Treble.ai) allows the extraction of data based on the applied tags, helping in team performance analysis, identification of bottlenecks in the service, and continuous improvement of the process.

### **How to create tags for conversations?**

It's important to note that, although any agent can use tags, only administrators have permission to create them, thus ensuring the organization of the system.

To create them, the administrator must access the top of the chat, click on the tags icon, and start the creation process. They will be able to name the tag and choose a color that represents the situation they want to highlight.

<img src="/images/add-label-2.gif" alt="Creating tags" />

### **Example of practical use of tags in Treble.ai**

Imagine that a customer contacted you with a question about payments. The agent can apply the **"Financial Query"** tag and, if necessary, refer to the financial team. If the conversation needs a follow-up later, it can receive the **"Awaiting Return"** tag, ensuring that no service is lost.

<img src="/images/add-label-3.gif" alt="Example of using tags" />

<Note>
Attention! In [Treble.ai](http://Treble.ai), the use of tags makes service **more agile, efficient, and strategic**, helping teams maintain fluid and organized communication. Implementing a standardized tag system is a simple and powerful way to improve customer experience and optimize your company's operation! ðŸ’¡

## 24-hour session of a conversation

Understand the functioning of the 24-hour windows used in WhatsApp API.

### What are sessions?

Sessions are **24-hour** time windows that begin when a customer sends a message through WhatsApp Business API. During this period, the company **can freely respond to the customer**. The session is renewed for another 24 hours each time the customer responds, allowing conversations to extend over several days, as long as there is constant interaction.

However, if the company tries to respond **after that time limit**, WhatsApp **blocks** the sending of normal messages. This happens because WhatsApp wants to prevent SPAM and ensure that companies communicate in a relevant way.

<img src="/images/session-time.png" alt="24-hour session" />

### **How to continue the conversation after 24 hours?**

If the window has closed and you need to resume contact, the only way to send a message is by using a **Message Template (HSM)** approved by WhatsApp.

#### What is a **Message Template (HSM)**?

- It's a message pre-approved by WhatsApp that can be used to reopen the conversation.
- It can contain dynamic variables (e.g.: customer name, scheduling date).
- It can be categorized as:
    - **Transactional** (example: "Your order has been confirmed! ðŸš€")
    - **Marketing** (example: "We have a special offer for you!")

### **Practical example**

Imagine that a customer contacted you at **10 in the morning yesterday** and your team responded normally throughout the day. However, today, **at 12 noon**, you realize you need to send a new message, but the window has already closed.

ðŸ”´ **Attempt to send a normal message â†’ WhatsApp blocks it.**

âœ… **Sending an approved Message Template â†’ WhatsApp allows reopening the conversation.**

As soon as the customer responds to the template, a **new 24-hour window** is opened, allowing normal conversations again.

<img src="/images/session-example.png" alt="Session example" />

### How to monitor the status of a conversation session?

<img src="/images/session-status.gif" alt="Session status" />

At the top of the chat, you'll find a countdown clock. It shows how much time is left until the session closes, starting at 23:59:59 and reaching 00:00:00.

#### **How to keep the conversation open?**

1. **Encourage user responses**: Ask for some interaction to ensure that the window stays open.
2. **Monitor the session time**: Implement internal notifications so agents know when a session is about to expire.

<Warning>
If your session expires, you'll need to send a Message Template (HSM) to resume the conversation.
</Warning>

## Conversation Summary Button

In **Treble.ai**, the **"Summary"** function allows agents to obtain an **automatic summary of the conversation** with the customer, generated by artificial intelligence. This resource **facilitates the follow-up of past services**, ensuring that any agent who interacts with the customer has access to essential information without needing to read the entire previous conversation.

### **How does the "Summary" button work?**

The **"Summary"** button can be activated every **10 minutes** and generates an **automated summary of the ongoing conversation**. This note is linked to the conversation and can be accessed by any agent who attends to that customer in the future.

The main uses of this resource include:

- **Recording important details of the service** without manual effort.
- **Maintaining an accessible and summarized history** for any agent.
- **Avoiding repetitive questions**, as the agent will have a previous context.

<img src="/images/summary-1.png" alt="Summary Button" />

### **Main benefits of automatic summary**

#### **Improvement in internal communication**

All agents can access previous summaries, ensuring that the customer doesn't need to repeat information in new services.

#### **Increased efficiency in service**

With a summarized history, agents can **resume the conversation quickly** without needing to review long message histories.

#### **Structured record for analysis**

Summaries generated by AI facilitate the tracking of **service patterns**, helping the company better understand customer needs.

### **How to use the automatic summary in Treble.ai?**

Simply click on the **"Summary"** button for the AI to generate a summary of the conversation. The agent can write more information in addition to what is already present in the note, ensuring that the record is useful for future interactions.

<img src="/images/summary-2.gif" alt="Using the automatic summary" />

### **Example of practical use of the automatic summary**

If a customer contacts you to ask about prices and, days later, returns to close the purchase, the new agent can view the **summary of the first service** and continue the conversation smoothly, without needing to redo unnecessary questions.
