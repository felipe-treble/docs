## Main View Sections

When you first log into the platform, you'll see the main view. This view is divided into 3 sections: incoming conversations view, conversation response view, and a right panel with account information. Let's understand how each section works.

### Incoming Conversations View

In this view, you'll see all incoming conversations you have on the platform. If you've used platforms like WhatsApp Web or ticketing tools, you'll see the conversations you've received.

As an agent, you'll start receiving incoming conversations. When you click on a conversation, you'll see the conversation history and be able to respond to it.

#### Agent Active Status

An important point is that as an agent, you can only see incoming conversations if your status is active. If your status is inactive, new conversations won't be assigned to you.

To change your status, you can do so in the configuration panel on the left by clicking on your profile icon and then clicking **Change to active**. You'll know you're active when you see your profile icon in green.

Similarly, you can change your status to inactive by clicking on your profile icon and then clicking **Change to inactive**.

<Warning>
Closing the tab, logging out, or closing your browser window <u>will not change your status back to inactive</u>. For that, you must click on your profile icon and then click **Change to inactive**.

If your agent doesn't change their status to inactive, they will continue receiving incoming conversations.
</Warning>

<Note>
It's important to mention that as an agent, you can only receive conversations if you belong to a team and the conversation is for your team. If you don't belong to a team, or you belong to a team but the conversation isn't for your team, you won't be able to see the conversation.
</Note>

Additionally, you can sort incoming conversations by the following criteria:

- Last message sent
- Last message by client
- New conversations
- Transferred conversations
- Label color

To search for a conversation, you can use the search field at the top. You can also use the search field to search for a conversation by the client's phone number.

### Conversation Response View

When you click on an incoming conversation, you'll see the conversation response view. In this view, you'll see the conversation history and be able to respond to it. This view reflects the conversation history in real-time. You'll even find read receipts and delivery receipts for WhatsApp messages.

In the top panel you'll see (from left to right):

- The client's name. This can be the name the client has on their WhatsApp account or you'll see the client's phone number.
- Session duration: Chats can only remain open for 24 hours. If the client doesn't respond within that time, the chat will close and you won't be able to respond.
- <Icon icon="sparkles" /> Artificial intelligence function to generate a conversation summary. Your agent can use this function to generate a summary of the conversation.
- <Icon icon="circle-check" /> Button to end the conversation with the client.
- <Icon icon="pencil" /> Button to edit client information.
- <Icon icon="tag" /> Button to add a label to the conversation.
- <Icon icon="arrow-right-arrow-left" /> Button to transfer the conversation to another agent.

#### Conversation Labels

Labels are a way to categorize conversations. You can add labels to conversations so you can organize and search for them more easily.

To add a label, click on the label icon and select the label you want to add. In this same view, you can also create a new label.

### Account Information Panel

In the account information panel, you'll see additional conversation information. Here you can find **Contact Information**, **Quick Reply Templates**, and **Attached Files and Documents**.
